    * Lambda functions (anonymous functions).
    * Built-in functions (e.g., `len()`, `type()`, `print()`, `range()`, `abs()`, `round()`, `min()`, `max()`).
* **Conditional Statements:**
    * `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making.
    * `while` loops for repetitive execution based on conditions.
    * `for` loops for iterating over sequences.
    * `break` and `continue` statements for loop control.

    * DataFrame indexing, slicing, and filtering.
    * Handling missing data.
    * Data cleaning and transformation.
    * Data aggregation and grouping.
* **Data Input/Output:**
    * Reading and writing data from/to CSV files, Excel files, and other formats.

**Week 6: Matplotlib and Seaborn - Data Visualization**

    * Creating basic plots (line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms).
    * Customizing plots (titles, labels, legends, colors, styles).
    * Subplots and figure management.
* **Seaborn:**
    * Statistical data visualization.
    * Distribution plots (histograms, KDE plots, box plots, violin plots).
    * Relational plots (scatter plots, line plots).
    * Categorical plots (bar plots, count plots, box plots).
    * Heatmaps and other advanced plot types.
